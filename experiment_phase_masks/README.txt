These phase masks were made by Dave Peplar, CLF.

They were generated for experiments on the Gemini laser facility, and printed on acetate.

The phase masks are binary; the relative phase difference between pixels marked as '0' and '1' is pi radians.

For the 150 mm diameter Gemini beam, the phase masks were printed 177.8 mm wide, with a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels (each pixel is 173.6 x 173.6 microns).
