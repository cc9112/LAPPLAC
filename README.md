# LAPPLAC
Diffractive laser beam propagator.

**n.b. this is a python-translated version of the LAPPLAC code, originally written by Rob Shalloo (Uni of Oxford) in Matlab.**

The code takes an input initial electric field (amplitude and phase) and solves for its evolution through a given medium or refractive index, Î·.
